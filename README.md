## Specialization Overview
This specialization includes four courses that cover the essential aspects of data science, from foundational knowledge to practical applications.

### Want to know if this Specialization is right for you?

It is if you are a:
- Beginner who wants to explore a career in data science.
- Professional in other fields who wants to transition into data science.
- Anyone looking to gain hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and data science tools.

However, this course may not be ideal if:
- You are already an advanced data scientist looking for more specialized or niche topics.
- You are seeking highly advanced techniques and algorithms beyond an introductory level.

### What you need to know before starting
- Basic understanding of *programming concepts*.
- Familiarity with *statistics* and *mathematics*.

### Upon Completion
Upon completion of the specialization, you will receive a certificate that validates your skills and knowledge in data science.

- **Certificate Title:** Introduction to Data Science
